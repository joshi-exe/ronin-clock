> Definition of **'ronin'** <br>
> *a lordless samurai, esp one whose feudal lord had been deprived of his territory.*<br>
> **Etymology:** The word rōnin is usually translated to 'drifter' or 'wanderer'; It is an idiomatic expression for 'vagrant' or 'wandering man', someone who finds the way without belonging to one place.<br>
> The word is used to create an analogy for defining 'floating' things, which don't belong to a specific category of a certain thing or a certain type.
